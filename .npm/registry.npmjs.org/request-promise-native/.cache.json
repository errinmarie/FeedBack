Everything applies to `request-promise-native` except the following:\n- Instead of using Bluebird promises this library uses native ES6 promises.\n- Mind that native ES6 promises have fewer features than Bluebird promises do. In particular, the `.finally(...)` method is not available.\n\n## Installation\n\nThis module is installed via npm:\n\n```\nnpm install --save request\nnpm install --save request-promise-native\n```\n\n`request` is defined as a peer-dependency and thus has to be installed separately.\n\n## Migration from `request-promise` to `request-promise-native`\n\n1. Go through the [migration instructions](https://github.com/request/request-promise#migration-from-v3-to-v4) to upgrade to `request-promise` v4.\n2. Ensure that you don't use Bluebird-specific features on the promise returned by your request calls. In particular, you can't use `.finally(...)` anymore.\n3. You are done.\n\n## Contributing\n\nTo set up your development environment:\n\n1. clone the repo to your desktop,\n2. in the shell `cd` to the main folder,\n3. hit `npm install`,\n4. hit `npm install gulp -g` if you haven't installed gulp globally yet, and\n5. run `gulp dev`. (Or run `node ./node_modules/.bin/gulp dev` if you don't want to install gulp globally.)\n\n`gulp dev` watches all source files and if you save some changes it will lint the code and execute all tests. The test coverage report can be viewed from `./coverage/lcov-report/index.html`.\n\nIf you want to debug a test you should use `gulp test-without-coverage` to run all tests without obscuring the code by the test coverage instrumentation.\n\n## Change History\n\n- v1.0.5 (2017-09-22)\n    - Upgraded `tough-cookie` to a version without regex DoS vulnerability\n      *(Thanks to @sophieklm for [pull request #13](https://github.com/request/request-promise-native/pull/13))*\n- v1.0.4 (2017-05-07)\n    - Fix that allows to use `tough-cookie` for [cookie creation](https://github.com/request/request-promise#include-a-cookie)\n- v1.0.3 (2016-08-08)\n    - Renamed internally used package `@request/promise-core` to `request-promise-core` because there where [too](https://github.com/request/request-promise/issues/137) [many](https://github.com/request/request-promise/issues/141) issues with the scoped package name\n- v1.0.2 (2016-07-18)\n    - Fix for using with module bundlers like Webpack and Browserify\n- v1.0.1 (2016-07-17)\n    - Fixed `@request/promise-core` version for safer versioning\n- v1.0.0 (2016-07-15)\n    - Initial version similar to [`request-promise`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request-promise) v4\n\n## License (ISC)\n\nIn case you never heard about the [ISC license](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC_license) it is functionally equivalent to the MIT license.\n\nSee the [LICENSE file](LICENSE) for details.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"analog-nico","email":"nicolai.kamenzky@testrails.org"},{"name":"request","email":"request@outofindex.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2018-08-27T18:55:32.023Z","created":"2016-05-07T06:44:22.851Z","0.0.0":"2016-05-07T06:44:22.851Z","1.0.0":"2016-07-16T00:23:18.177Z","1.0.1":"2016-07-18T00:20:25.049Z","1.0.2":"2016-07-18T20:12:17.633Z","1.0.3":"2016-08-08T11:27:17.880Z","1.0.4":"2017-05-08T01:54:45.758Z","1.0.5":"2017-09-22T16:54:16.350Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/request/request-promise-native#readme","keywords":["xhr","http","https","promise","request","then","thenable","native"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/request/request-promise-native.git"},"author":{"name":"Nicolai Kamenzky","url":"https://github.com/analog-nico"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/request/request-promise-native/issues"},"license":"ISC","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"cajoy":true,"abuddington":true,"nilz3ro":true,"hugojosefson":true,"fenrir":true,"karneyeu":true,"kkho595":true,"drewigg":true,"bpmccurdy":true,"carlosvillademor":true,"nauhil":true,"ethzero":true,"mjurincic":true,"heartnett":true,"nickgogan":true,"buru1020":true,"jeremy-j-ackso":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"W/\"e1a265ab1e7089d498d0d0bb54dd80a8\"","_lastModified":"Mon, 27 Aug 2018 18:55:43 GMT"}
