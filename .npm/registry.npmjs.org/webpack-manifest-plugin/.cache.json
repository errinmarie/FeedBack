[![Gitter](https://img.shields.io/gitter/room/nwjs/nw.js.svg)](https://gitter.im/webpack-manifest-plugin#)\n\n\nWebpack plugin for generating an asset manifest.\n\n> NOTE: The following is related to the next major version of `webpack-manifest-plugin`, please check https://github.com/danethurber/webpack-manifest-plugin/blob/1.x/README.md for `v1` documentation\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev webpack-manifest-plugin\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nIn your `webpack.config.js`\n\n```javascript\nvar ManifestPlugin = require('webpack-manifest-plugin');\n\nmodule.exports = {\n    // ...\n    plugins: [\n      new ManifestPlugin()\n    ]\n};\n```\n\nThis will generate a `manifest.json` file in your root output directory with a mapping of all source file names to their corresponding output file, for example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mods/alpha.js\": \"mods/alpha.1234567890.js\",\n  \"mods/omega.js\": \"mods/omega.0987654321.js\"\n}\n```\n\n\n## API:\n\n```js\n// webpack.config.js\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  output: {\n    publicPath\n  },\n  plugins: [\n    new ManifestPlugin(options)\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### `options.fileName`\n\nType: `String`<br>\nDefault: `manifest.json`\n\nThe manifest filename in your output directory.\n\n### `options.publicPath`\n\nType: `String`\nDefault: `output.publicPath`\n\nA path prefix that will be added to values of the manifest.\n\n### `options.basePath`\n\nType: `String`\n\nA path prefix for all keys. Useful for including your output path in the manifest.\n\n\n### `options.writeToFileEmit`\n\nType: `Boolean`<br>\nDefault: `false`\n\nIf set to `true` will emit to build folder and memory in combination with `webpack-dev-server`\n\n\n### `options.seed`\n\nType: `Object`<br>\nDefault: `{}`\n\nA cache of key/value pairs to used to seed the manifest. This may include a set of [custom key/value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json) pairs to include in your manifest, or may be used to combine manifests across compilations in [multi-compiler mode](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/tree/master/examples/multi-compiler). To combine manifests, pass a shared seed object to each compiler's ManifestPlugin instance.\n\n### `options.filter`\n\nType: `Function(FileDescriptor): Boolean`\n\nFilter out files. [FileDescriptor typings](#filedescriptor)\n\n\n### `options.map`\n\nType: `Function(FileDescriptor): FileDescriptor`\n\nModify files details before the manifest is created. [FileDescriptor typings](#filedescriptor)\n\n### `options.sort`\n\nType: `Function(FileDescriptor): number`\n\nSort files before they are passed to `generate`. [FileDescriptor typings](#filedescriptor)\n\n### `options.generate`\n\nType: `Function(Object, FileDescriptor): Object`<br>\nDefault: `(seed, files) => files.reduce((manifest, {name, path}) => ({...manifest, [name]: path}), seed)`\n\nCreate the manifest. It can return anything as long as it's serialisable by `JSON.stringify`. [FileDescriptor typings](#filedescriptor)\n\n### `options.serialize`\n\nType: `Function(Object): string`<br>\nDefault: `(manifest) => JSON.stringify(manifest, null, 2)`\n\nOutput manifest file in different format then json (i.e. yaml).\n\n## FileDescriptor\n\n```ts\nFileDescriptor {\n  path: string;\n  name: string | null;\n  isInitial: boolean;\n  isChunk: boolean;\n  chunk?: Chunk;\n  isAsset: boolean;\n  isModuleAsset: boolean;\n}\n```\n\n### `chunk`\n\nType: [`Chunk`](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/master/lib/Chunk.js)\n\nOnly available is `isChunk` is `true`\n\n### `isInitial`\n\nType: `Boolean`\n\nIs required to run you app. Cannot be `true` if `isChunk` is `false`.\n\n### `isModuleAsset`\n\nType: `Boolean`\n\nIs required by a module. Cannot be `true` if `isAsset` is `false`.\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT © [Dane Thurber](https://github.com/danethurber)\n","maintainers":[{"email":"dane.thurber@gmail.com","name":"danethurber"},{"email":"th.sileghem@gmail.com","name":"mastilver"}],"time":{"modified":"2018-09-12T09:09:23.545Z","created":"2015-05-06T13:39:47.537Z","0.0.1":"2015-05-06T13:39:47.537Z","0.0.2":"2015-05-21T21:00:37.797Z","0.2.0":"2015-06-07T23:11:34.573Z","0.3.0":"2015-07-02T14:20:18.411Z","0.4.0":"2015-08-06T21:12:09.881Z","0.5.0":"2015-10-31T14:18:07.275Z","1.0.0":"2016-02-07T16:55:53.554Z","1.0.1":"2016-04-26T02:33:18.022Z","1.1.0-0":"2016-10-19T15:26:15.276Z","1.1.0":"2016-10-19T15:36:52.850Z","1.1.1":"2017-07-06T19:23:17.713Z","1.1.2":"2017-07-07T14:07:06.239Z","1.2.0":"2017-07-20T18:34:20.255Z","1.2.1":"2017-07-20T23:09:14.488Z","1.3.0":"2017-08-09T20:58:36.353Z","1.3.1":"2017-08-14T11:57:58.907Z","1.3.2":"2017-09-14T12:39:52.622Z","2.0.0-rc.1":"2017-09-21T12:00:00.621Z","2.0.0-rc.2":"2018-02-28T23:03:15.733Z","2.0.0":"2018-04-08T16:26:42.147Z","2.0.1":"2018-04-19T12:23:39.215Z","2.0.2":"2018-04-29T20:30:42.320Z","2.0.3":"2018-05-22T18:10:59.518Z","2.0.4":"2018-09-12T09:09:20.827Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/danethurber/webpack-manifest-plugin","repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/danethurber/webpack-manifest-plugin.git"},"author":{"name":"Dane Thurber","email":"dane.thurber@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/danethurber/webpack-manifest-plugin/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"qbylucky":true,"ackhub":true,"cognivator":true,"detj":true,"jcurtis":true,"gabrielschlomo":true,"sqrtthree":true,"xu_q90":true,"arkanciscan":true,"bourne":true,"zhilidali":true,"fengmiaosen":true,"landy2014":true,"bro_strummer":true,"martinspinks":true,"sszhu":true,"rbultitude":true,"myalin":true,"budiantoip":true,"luffy84217":true,"isenricho":true,"flayks":true,"calin.buzatu":true},"_etag":"W/\"2a9063e6f52d618dc79916c279ff6990\"","_lastModified":"Wed, 12 Sep 2018 09:09:24 GMT"}
