        Use CSS to accomplish the following tasks:

        Challenge 1:
        Make the p tags have "darkblue" text and a black border.

        Challenge 2:
        Look up a font on Google Fonts (example, Monotron) and make the H1 tag
        have that font.

        Challenge 3:
        Make the div with the class "right-floating-box" have a darkblue
        background and white foreground text.

        Challenge 4:
        Give the page a lavendar background.

        Challenge 5:
        Use "float: left" along with setting a width and height in pixels to
        make the div with the class "right-floating-box" be to the right of
        everything else. Give it some padding, also.

        Bonus Challenge 1:
        Create from scratch an "ERROR" box style at the bottom.

        Bonus Challenge 2:
        Look into the ":before" pseudo-selector to make every paragraph start
        with an emoji using CSS.
