# HINT 1: Lines starting with '#' are comments & ignored
# HINT 2: Only do one challenge at a time! Save and test after each challenge.

# Challenge 1:
# 1. Write Python code here to print 'Hello World!'
# 2. Save this file
# 3. Run it it in a terminal


print("Hello World")


# Challenge 2:
# Write more print statements, to print out your favorite poem, song lyric, or
# multi-line excerpt of text. There are two ways to do this:
# 1. The more obvious is by writing many print functions, one after another,
# just like you did for "hello world" but more.
# 2. A less obvious one is by using ''' ''' or """ """ style quotation marks
# (triple quotation marks), that lets you go across many lines.
# Pick one (or both) and go for it!

print("We didn't start the fire")
print("It was always burning since the world's been turning")

print("""yeah yeah yeah
We didn't start the fire!
yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah""")


# Challenge 3:
# Use print and arithmetic operators to print out the results of 3 different
# calculations. E.g., print(2 + 2) could be one, but try getting more
# complicated!

print(2-1)
print(17 + 18)


# Challenge 4:
# - Try to guess why print('2 + 2') is different than print(2 + 2)
# - Try to guess why print('2' + '2') is different than print(2 + 2)

print('2 + '2)
print('2' + '2')



# NOTE: For the bonus challenges, this is a useful blog post:
# https://dbader.org/blog/python-string-formatting

# BONUS CHALLENGE 1:
# Look up the 'format' string method for Python. 'Uncomment' the following
# lines and modify each of them to say 'The answer is 42'.
#print('The {} is {}')
#print('The {0} is {1}')
#print('The {1} is {0}')
#print('The {noun} is {number}')

# BONUS CHALLENGE 2:
# Look up Formatted String Literals, only available in the latest versions of
# Python (3.6 and newer).  'Uncomment' the following line and add extra code to
# make it say 'The answer is 42'.
#print(f'The {noun} is {number}')

# BONUS CHALLENGE 3:
# Do the same thing as before, except using the C-inspired "printf-style"
# Python string interpolation.
#print('The %s is %i')
#print('The %(noun)s is %(number)i')
