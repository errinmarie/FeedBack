<!--
    For this activity, you'll need to write both HTML and CSS from scratch to
    recreate the mockup (see images/futurama_mockup.png).

    Think about grouping together certain elements into "<div>" elements,
    giving those div elements classes of names you invent (like <div
    class="MainContent"> ....</div>) and then giving those classes you created
    the right CSS to lay everything out and style it as you see in the image.

    Time to put together all the CSS and HTML you've learned thus far!
