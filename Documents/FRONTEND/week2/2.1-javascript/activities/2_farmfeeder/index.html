        Challenge 1: As a matter of good practice, add a console.log to this
        script tag (outside of the comments) and confirm you can see it in your
        browser console. 

        E.g.:
            console.log('Hello Farm World!')

        Hint: The code is written, but it's not yet "hooked up" to get run when
        you click on the pig.

        2. Add an onClick attribute on the pig image to call feedPig to the pig
        image.

        Hint: You will need to use code like
            onClick="feedPig()"
        on the image in the HTML code above.

        Bonus Challenge #1:
        - Time to DRY things out! Identify patterns in your code, and refactor

        - Hint: A logical thing to DRY out is the DOM updating code. You might
          want to move that into it's own function called "render" and have
          that be called at the end of each of the event functions.

          rapidly using setInterval
        - If any of them get to 0, that animal "starves", and the player loses.
