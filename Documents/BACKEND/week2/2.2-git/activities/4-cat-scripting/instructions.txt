Challenge 1
Redo the previous activity, but instead of running each cat command on
the terminal, save it into a shell script file named "build.sh", then
run the file.


Challenge 2
Make a change to one of the HTML fragments, then re-run the shell script
and confirm that it "updates" from the previous time.
