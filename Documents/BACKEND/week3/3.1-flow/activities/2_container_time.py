# Challenge 0: Remember, what's the first thing you should add to any Python
# file you are working with?
# (Answer: add a "print", to make sure you are editing the right file!)


print('--------------- Challenge 1')
# Challenge 1:
# Modify this list to be a list of your top 5 favorite animals. This can be
# done by following the pattern of 'kitty'.
favorite_animals_list = [
    'kitty', 'doggo', 'hamster', 'gerbil', 'kangaroo',
]







print('--------------- Challenge 2')
# Challenge 2:
# Use print statements, print each of your favorite animals on a separate line.
# Printing "kitty" is done for you, but commented out -- how will you print the
# others?


print(favorite_animals_list[0])
print(favorite_animals_list[1])
print(favorite_animals_list[2])
print(favorite_animals_list[3])
print(favorite_animals_list[4])






print('--------------- Challenge 3')
# Challenge 3:
# Now it's time to write a dictionary! It should be just like the list, except
# with each "key" being the name of the animal, and each "value" being the
# noise that it makes. The first one (kitty) is done for you.
favorite_animals_dict = {
    'kitty': 'meow',
    'doggo': 'woof',
    'hamster': 'silence',
    'gerbil': 'snuffle',
    'kangaroo': 'hoppo',
}







print('--------------- Challenge 4')
# Challenge 4:
# Now, using the dictionary you made in challenge 3, print each animal name,
# followed by the noise it makes. Kitty is done for you, but "commented out".
#
# Hint: You can use "," in print to print multiple things on the same line

print(
'Kitty says:', favorite_animals_dict['kitty'], ', '
'Doggo says:', favorite_animals_dict['doggo'], ', '
'Hamster says:', favorite_animals_dict['hamster'], ', '
'Gerbil says:', favorite_animals_dict['gerbil'], ', '
'Kangaroo says:', favorite_animals_dict['kangaroo'],
)








print('--------------- Challenge 5')
# Challenge 5:
# Data types can be combined. Transform the following list into a dictionary
# where each key is the category of animal, and the values are the list of the
# animals that fall under that category.

animals = {
    'canines': ['dogs', 'wolves'], 
    'felines': ['cats', 'tigers'], 
    'rodents': ['mice', 'hamsters', 'gerbils', 'capybaras'],
    'notochord retaining fish': ['hagfish', 'lamprey', 'coelacanth', 'sturgeon'],
}
print(animals)





# Advanced Bonus Challenge:
# This is a "code design" challenge. What type of container data-type would you
# use for each of the following scenarios? Create an variable with example data
# for each scenario.
#
# 1. File paths, e.g. for content for a static site generator
# 2. Translation of words from one language to another
# 3. Dog breeds and their average longevity
# 4. Places in a mapping application like Google Maps or Yelp, including their
#    latitude and longitude and reviews
