# Faceboop Chat CRUD

- This is an open ended activity -- no step-by-step clues available for this one

- Being able to build a CRUD operation from scratch is one of the most
  important skills to have as a backend programmer

- You have the skeleton of a project, you need to add the Python code and make
  the HTML changes necessary to implement a CRUD-based chat system.

## Completed spec

- Post new posts with any username of your choice

- The ability to "thumbs up" posts

- The ability to delete posts

- The ability to edit posts to say different things

## Tips

- Don't try working from memory! Copy from previous activities.

- Work on one thing at a time. Use SQLite viewer and the admin interface to
  confirm each step is working before going to the next (solving any sort of
  "chicken and egg" problem)

- Usually a good idea to put off Delete and then Update for last -- Create and
  Read are enough for a basic activity.
