This activity is focused on understanding existing code.


Challenge 1
-----------
- Examine the code. Can you explain to the person next to you how all the files
  relate to each other?

- Hint: There are comment clues in the files.



Challenge 2
-----------

Get the code working!
1. Run "pipenv --python 3" to create a new virtualenv
2. Run "pipenv shell" to enter the virtualenv
3. Run "pipenv install" to install dependencies that are written in the
Pipfile (in this case, only Django)
4. Run python manage.py runserver to run the Django Python server itself
5. Now, visit localhost:8000 or 127.0.0.1:8000 (both will do the same thing).
6. What's the first thing you do with a new Python file? Add a print! Add a
print to the index function, just about the return statement.


Challenge 3
-----------

Practice making changes and additions. Can you do all of the following?

1. Modify the code to show your name instead of Ash Ketchum

2. Add a new page, with it's own "views" function and it's own template.

3. Add a CSS file to the static directory, and include it in a template.
