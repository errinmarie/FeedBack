# Challenge 0: Remember, to do the first thing for any Python activity!


print('------------- Challenge 1')
# Challenge 1:
# Try to predict what the following code will do. Uncomment it, and see if you
# got the prediction correct.

#x = 0
#while x < 10:
#    print(x)
#    x = x + 1


print('------------- Challenge 2')
# Challenge 2:
# Using a while loop, print out every odd number between 10 and 42.

# Hint 1: Start with Pseudocode
# Hint 2: There is a solution as simple as Challenge 1

x = 11
while x < 43:
    print(x)
    x = x + 2







print('------------- Challenge 3')
# Challenge 3:
# Write the pseudocode for a while loop that calculates the "factorial" of a
# number. Examples:
# 5 factorial: 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5
# 3 factorial: 1 * 2 * 3

#Multiply by 1
#    If the factorial is less than 5
#Multiply by 2
#    If the factorial is less than 5
#Multiply by 3
#   If the factorial is less than 5
#Multiply by 4
#    If the factorial is less than 5


print('------------- Challenge 4')
# Challenge 4:
# Using the pseudocode from challenge 3, write the Python code to calculate the
# factorial of a number.

x = 1
while x < 6:
    x * 1
    print(x)
    x * 2
    print(x)





print('------------- Challenge 5')
# Challenge 5:
# Examine the following commented out code. See if you can answer the following
# questions about it. Then, uncomment it and see if you are right.
# 1. What will cause this loop to stop?
# 2. Why does answer start as 'no'?

#answer = 'no'
#while answer == 'no':
#    answer = input('Done yet? ')








print('-------------')
# Bonus Challenge 1:
# Running average utility! Your task is to create a loop that keeps on asking
# the user for a number, and maintains a running average of the values the user
# entered. Stop when the user enters 0.
#
# Hint 1: Start with pseudocode!
# Hint 2: The "running average" can be computed by summing the number they
# entered with the current running average, and dividing the result by "2"








# Bonus Challenge 2:
# Remember the "locations" structure? Pseudocode, then write a while loop that
# keeps on asking for new locations, and adding them to the location structure,
# until the user tells it that the user wants to quit.
