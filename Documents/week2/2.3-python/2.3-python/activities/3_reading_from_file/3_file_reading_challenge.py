print('--------------- Challenge 1')
# Challenge 1:
# This code opens and reads a file, and puts the results into the variable
# named "contents".
# - Use print to print out the variable "contents" to make sure its working.
# - When working correctly, it should say "Hello File I/O World!"
contents = open('hello_world_file.txt').read()



print('--------------- Challenge 2')
# Challenge 2:
# Using Challenge 1 as a guide, write 3 lines of code to read the three text
# files in the "frankenstein" directory, which contain excerpts of the text of
# the novel, and put the results into three different variables named
# chapter_1, chapter_2, and chapter_3 respectively.
#
# Combine ("concatenate") the three chapters into a single variable, and print
# out that single variable.




print('--------------- Challenge 3')
# Challenge 3: 
# Using your text editor, examine the HTML fragments in the html_fragments
# directory. Can you figure out, based on indentation and other clues, which
# order the 4 fragments should be assembled in to make a valid HTML page?
#
# Write code that reads in these files and then combines them with that
# ordering.




# Bonus Challenge 1: 
# Remember that we can redirect the output of a command into a file using ">"?
# See if you can use Bash & Python in conjunction to reconstruct the whole HTML
# page using this technique into a HTML file.


# Bonus Challenge 2: 
# Randomize the order of words in the Frankenstein excerpt, and print out the
# randomized version.
# No hints here, you are on your own! :o
