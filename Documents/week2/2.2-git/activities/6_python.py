# HINT 1: Lines starting with "#" are a comment
# HINT 2: Only do one challenge at a time! Save and test after each challenge.

# HINT 3: Run this file by using the command:
#         python3 6_python.py

# HINT 4: Do not run "python3" by itself EVER, unless you want to go into
# "interactive mode" (represented by the ">"), which is only good for testing
# Python but not good for running files.

# Challenge 1: Write Python code to print "Hello World!", save, and run it

print("Hello World!")

# Challenge 2:
# Expand it to print out the first stanza of the Jabberwocky Poem. There are
# two ways to do this, either using many print calls, or by using Python's
# "multi-line" strings, which are done with ''' (or """).

print("""â€™Twas brillig, and the slithy toves 
      Did gyre and gimble in the wabe: 
All mimsy were the borogoves, 
      And the mome raths outgrabe.""")

# Challenge 3:
# Use a combination of print and arithmetic operators to print out the results
# of 3 different calculations. E.g., 2+2 could be one, but try getting more
# complicated!

print(2 + 2)
print(17 - 5)
print(22 / 11)

# Challenge 4:
# Try copying the following code, and remove the "#" from the beginning to
# transform it from being a comment:
#
# print(open('example_file.txt').read())
#
# What is it doing? Can you modify it to print out the contents of one of the
# previous activities?

print(open('pickles/index.html').read())


# ADVANCED CHALLENGE:
# 1. Write the code to print out the source code of this file.
# 2. Look up string methods for Python 3. See if you can combine the above code
# and use the "replace" method to print out the contents of this file, but with
# all mentions of the word "print" replaced with the word "echo"

print(open('6_python.py').read())
print (str.replace("print", "echo"))
